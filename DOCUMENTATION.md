# Fanny Pack UI - Components Built with and for SvelteKit
**NOTE: Webpack throws errors with import statements that use aliases like `$`. So I don't think I can use Storybook. Oh, well. I will just create my own interactive documentation using MDSVEX. Webpack is pretty slow and I don't love using apps like Storybook because of the limitations that you run into sometimes, so I prefer to create my own interactive documentation.**

# How to develop new components or edit existing components
1. I should create the component first inside the `/src/lib` directory (which is where a component library would need to be created).
2. Then test that component out on a page in the `/src/routes` directory to make sure that the component works properly in a regular SvelteKit app.
3. Write comprehensive tests for the component.
4. Then, for documentation purposes and to give other developers the ability to try out different variations of each component, I will create interactive documentation with controls (similar to what Storybook does) for each component in the `/src/routes` directory. These docs will be similar to the docs found in Carbon Components Svelte (https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/) and maybe Semantic UI.

# How to package and publish the Fanny Pack UI to npm

## Step 1: Organize your components so they can be imported easily
Inside of the `src/lib` folder, create a folder for each component. Inside of each of those folders create an `index.js` file that exports the component, like this:

```
export { default as Button } from "./Button.svelte";
```

Now create an `index.js` file directly inside of the `src/lib` folder. That `index.js` file should re-export each component, like this:

```
export { Button } from "./Button";
```

To see an example of this component exporting and re-exporting, look at the `carbon-components-svelte` GitHub repo: https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte/tree/master/src.

## Step 2: Required dependencies should be in the `dependencies` object
npm will automatically bundle any dependencies inside your `dependencies` object when it creates the tarball during the `npm publish` command. So make sure that any dependencies that are required for your package to work properly are installed as `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31215356/npm-does-not-publish-dependencies


## Step 3: Bump the version number up
You have to make sure that the package name and package version combination don't exist already; if so, the package will not be published on npm. So you need to bump up the version number in the `package.json` file (that is in the root directory) before you continue.


## Step 4: Push your updates to GitHub
Make sure to save your code by `add`ing, `commit`ing, and `push`ing to GitHub before you continue.


## Step 5: Turn your component library into an npm package
*NOTE: If you did not initialize a TypeScript SvelteKit project, then you will need to install a dependency called `svelte2tsx`, which will convert the Svelte component source into TSX: `npm install --save-dev svelte2tsx`. ([Source](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-your-own-component-library-svelte/))*

Run the following from the root of the project:

```
npm run package
```

This command will take all the files that are under the `src/lib` folder and make them available as a package. This command generates a new directory called `package` at the root of your project. Inside of that `package` directory you will notice that there is a new `package.json` file. This file consists of an attribute called `exports`, which consists of all the paths or entry points to the individual components that we have developed.

## Step 6: Login to npm
Read how to do login here: http://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/logging-in-and-out.html


## Step 7: Publish to npm with a scoped package
In order to distribute this package to other developers and allow them to install it as an npm package you need to publish it to npm. To publish this as an npm module run the following command from inside the directory that contains your `package.json` file:

```
npm publish ./package
```

NOTE: Since this uses a scoped package name, the first time you publish this package you will have to specify that this should be a public package. (If you want this to be a private package with a scoped name, then you can pay for that.)

```
npm publish ./package --access=public
```

# Deployment to Cloudflare
* Follow these instructions for deploying a SvelteKit project: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/, but use these settings instead of the ones described in that article:
    * When creating a new project in your Cloudflare dashboard, use the "Framework preset" for SvelteKit.
    * IMPORTANT: SvelteKit requires Node.js v14.x or later to build successfully. You must expand the Environment Variables (advanced) section and add a `NODE_VERSION` variable with a value of `16` or greater.
    * In your `svelte.config.js` file, use the `adapter-auto` that is already installed by default in SvelteKit instead of the `adapter-static` that is mentioned in the Cloudflare guide.
* Follow these instructions to add custom domains, etc: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/.

# How to develop a local package and install it as an npm package

You can install the local `package` directory as a package in your `package.json` file. This comes in handy in situations where you want to develop your component library locally. You could then move your package to npm and use it in other projects.

Many of these concepts are borrowed from this tutorial: [The Ultimate Guide to Building a UI Component Libraryâ€”Part 2: Establishing a Development Environment](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/ultimate-guide-to-building-ui-component-library-part-2-environment)

## Step 1: Turn your component library into a package

Follow steps 1 and 5 under the heading "How to package and publish the Fanny Pack UI to npm" (above).

You can then either publish this package to npm and install it from there (above, which is good for distributing the component library to other developers to use in their projects), or you can install the local `package` directory as a package in your `package.json` file (below, which is good for locally developing the component library).


## Step 2: Allow Vite to serve files from the `package` folder

Vite will not serve files from the `package` folder by default. If you try to import your components into a `src/routes` file, then you will see the following error:

```
The request url "/path/to/package/folder" is outside of Vite serving allow list.
```

To fix this problem, open the `svelte.config.js` file, add the following `vite.server.fs.allow` config:

```
kit: {
  ...

  vite: () => ({
    server: {
      fs: {
        allow: [
          "package"
        ]
      }
    }
  }),
},
```

See:
* https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-fs-allow
* https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2701


## Step 3: Install your local library/package and import components

In order to use your local component library in the rest of your app (i.e. the files inside your `src/routes` directory), you will have to install them. From the project root directoy run the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev ./package
```

When you use `npm install` you almost always want to install npm packages from the global npm registry. For example, `npm install --save-dev svelte` tells npm to look for a package named "svelte" in its registry, and to install it into your application.

However, npm can also install local packages (aka a directory on your local machine that has a `package.json` file in it), and you can do so by passing npm a path to the directory to install. So in this case, `npm install --save-dev ./package` tells npm to install the package in the `package` directory in your demo app.

If you open your demo application's `package.json` file, you'll see a new `devDependency` for "@fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit" that looks like this:

```
"@fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit": "file:package",
```

This is a link that gives you the ability to use your components in your example app. This is how you would import a component into a `.svelte` file in the example app:

```
import { Button } from "@fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit";
```

## Step 4: Develop and edit components and update to the latest version from your local `package` directory

Since you have already installed the local `@fanny-pack-ui` library as a package, the link has been established from the files in the `package` folder to the `package.json` file. So now when you create any new components or update any existing components, all you need to do to get those updates is run the `npm run package` command to rebuild the `@fanny-pack-ui` library into a package. The link in the `package.json` file will simply reference the latest version of your library/package. And you can keep building/updating your components and then running `npm run package`.

# How to add `postcss-preset-env` (for native CSS nesting) and `mdsvex` (for Markdown documentation)

* The `postcss-preset-env` config and notes are below.
* Use `svelte-add` to install `mdsvex`, which will configure everything for you: https://github.com/svelte-add/mdsvex. Then you can create `.svelte.md` files and start creating regular Svelte components with Markdown syntax sprinkled throughout. I like to use Markdown to document code blocks in between opening and closing triple backticks. 
    * NOTE: I think `mdsvex` conflicts with Storybook's MDX installation and throws silent errors, so if you want to install `mdsvex` alongside Storybook then you might run into problems. I would just use the default MDX installation.

```js
// svelte.config.js

import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex";
import mdsvexConfig from "./mdsvex.config.js";
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import preprocess from "svelte-preprocess";
import postcssPresetEnv from "postcss-preset-env";
// __dirname is not available in ES modules: https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_no_filename_or_dirname
// This issue has a fix: https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/2907
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

/** @type {import("@sveltejs/kit").Config} */
const config = {
	extensions: [".svelte", ...mdsvexConfig.extensions],

	// Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess
	// for more information about preprocessors
	preprocess: [
		preprocess({
			postcss: {
				plugins: [
					// * How to configure the postcssPresetEnv plugin:

					postcssPresetEnv({

							"nesting-rules": true
						},

					})
				]
			}
		}),
		mdsvex(mdsvexConfig)
	],

	kit: {
		adapter: adapter(),

		// hydrate the <div id="svelte"> element in src/app.html
		target: "#svelte",

		vite: () => ({
			// Aliases: https://dev.to/danawoodman/how-to-add-module-import-aliases-in-sveltekit-2ck

					$: path.resolve(__dirname, "/src")

			server: {
				fs: {
					allow: ["package"]
				}

		})
	}
};

export default config;

# How to update SveltKit to latest version

1. Search for "sveltekit changelog".
2. Find the latest version number.
3. Run `npm update @sveltejs/kit@<version#>`. For example: `npm update @sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.445`
