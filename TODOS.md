# TODOS
1. I need to package this up as an npm package and see if I can import it into Tremain Academy to make sure that these components work and that I am creating them correctly.
2. Finish organizing the theme variables in the `/lib/theme.css` file.

* Figure out how to customize/edit fonts after the component library has been installed. This question asks the same thing: https://dev.to/kevinccbsg/comment/jgpk. I need to explore how this would work. Maybe I would define fonts style rules in the `utils.css` file.
