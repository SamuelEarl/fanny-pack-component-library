 * I don't love using a bunch of utility classes, but a handful of utility classes can be helpful. 
 * This file contains utility classes that are used throughout the component library. For example the .spin class is used to spin icons during loading states.
 * These utility classes can be added to a component's HTML to provide some CSS functionality while avoiding duplicated CSS style rule definitions.
