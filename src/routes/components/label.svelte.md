# Label

The `<Label>` component is already included with the components that use a `<label>` element. If you pass a `string` to the component's `label` prop, then the `<Label>` component will be included automatically.

## Example Usage


NOTES:
* Mention the `<Tooltip>` component along with the default tooltip icon that can be changed in the `fpcl-theme.ts` file.
