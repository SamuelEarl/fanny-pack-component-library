# Label

The `<Label>` component is already included with the components that should/can use a `<label>` tag. (See [HTML `<label>` Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp) for a list of HTML elements that use the `<label>` tag.) 

For the components that include a `<Label>` by default, if you pass a `string` to the component's `label` prop, then the `<Label>` component will be included automatically.

## Example Usage


NOTES:
* Mention the `<Tooltip>` component along with the default tooltip icon that can be changed in the `fpcl-theme.ts` file.
